# Go Concurrency: Patterns AI Tools Often Miss

## The Power of Go's Concurrency Model

Go's concurrency model is one of its most distinctive features. While AI tools can generate concurrent code, they often miss the subtle patterns and best practices that make Go concurrency truly effective.

### Common AI Misconceptions

1. **Channel Usage**: AI often suggests channels when a mutex would be more appropriate
2. **Goroutine Management**: Overlooking proper goroutine lifecycle management
3. **Context Usage**: Missing proper context propagation and cancellation

### Staying Fluent

1. **Channel Patterns**:
   - Pipeline pattern
   - Fan-out, fan-in
   - Worker pools
   - Select with default cases

2. **Context Usage**:
   - Proper context propagation
   - Cancellation signals
   - Timeout handling

3. **Sync Package**:
   - When to use mutexes vs channels
   - Proper use of sync.WaitGroup
   - sync.Once for initialization

### Practical Example

Let's look at a practical example that demonstrates these concurrency patterns. The example is available in the `examples/example2` directory of this project.

#### Running the Example

The example provides two different concurrency patterns:

1. Worker Pool Pattern:
```bash
go run main.go --example2
```

2. Pipeline Pattern:
```bash
go run main.go --example2-pipeline
```

#### Example Structure

The example demonstrates two common concurrency patterns:

1. **Worker Pool Pattern**:
```go
type Worker struct {
    id     int
    ctx    context.Context
    wg     *sync.WaitGroup
    jobs   <-chan int
    results chan<- int
}
```

This pattern shows:
- Proper goroutine lifecycle management
- Context-based cancellation
- Channel-based communication
- WaitGroup synchronization
- Graceful shutdown

2. **Pipeline Pattern**:
```go
// Create channels for the pipeline
numbers := make(chan int)
squares := make(chan int)
results := make(chan int)

// Pipeline stages
go func() { /* generate numbers */ }()
go func() { /* square numbers */ }()
go func() { /* process results */ }()
```

This pattern demonstrates:
- Channel-based data flow
- Stage-based processing
- Proper channel closing
- Context-based cancellation

#### Key Implementation Details

The example includes:

1. **Worker Pool Implementation**:
   - Worker struct with proper lifecycle management
   - Context-based cancellation
   - Channel-based job distribution
   - Result collection
   - Graceful shutdown

2. **Pipeline Implementation**:
   - Multiple processing stages
   - Channel-based data flow
   - Proper channel closing
   - Error handling
   - Timeout management

When you run the examples, you'll see:
1. For the worker pool:
   - Jobs being distributed to workers
   - Results being collected
   - Graceful shutdown after timeout

2. For the pipeline:
   - Numbers being generated
   - Numbers being squared
   - Results being processed
   - Proper channel closing

This demonstrates how proper concurrency patterns lead to:
- Better resource utilization
- Cleaner code organization
- Proper error handling
- Graceful shutdown
- Efficient data processing

### Key Takeaways

- Understand when to use channels vs mutexes
- Master context propagation and cancellation
- Learn proper goroutine lifecycle management
- Practice error handling in concurrent code
- Understand the sync package deeply
- Use appropriate concurrency patterns for your use case
