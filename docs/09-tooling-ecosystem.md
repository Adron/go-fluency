# Go Tooling: Beyond AI's Basic Suggestions

## Mastering Go's Tooling Ecosystem

Go's tooling ecosystem is rich and powerful. While AI tools can suggest basic tool usage, they often miss the deeper integration and workflow optimizations.

### Common AI Tooling Gaps

1. **Build Tools**: Missing advanced build options
2. **Code Generation**: Not utilizing code generation effectively
3. **Static Analysis**: Overlooking important linters

### Staying Fluent

1. **Build Tools**:
   ```bash
   # AI might suggest:
   go build
   
   # Better:
   go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags=prod
   ```

2. **Code Generation**:
   - `go generate`
   - Protocol buffers
   - Mock generation
   - Stringer

3. **Static Analysis**:
   - `golangci-lint`
   - `go vet`
   - `staticcheck`

### Practical Tips

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Editor integration
   - Debugging tools
   - Profiling tools
   - Testing tools

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Build pipelines
   - Test automation
   - Code coverage
   - Security scanning

### Key Takeaways

- Master build tools
- Understand code generation
- Learn static analysis
- Practice debugging
- Consider CI/CD integration
