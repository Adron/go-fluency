# Go Performance: Beyond AI's Basic Optimizations

## Performance Optimization in Go

Go's performance characteristics are unique, and while AI tools can suggest basic optimizations, they often miss the deeper performance considerations that matter in production systems.

### Common AI Performance Gaps

1. **Memory Allocation**: Missing opportunities for memory optimization
2. **Garbage Collection**: Not considering GC impact
3. **Concurrency Patterns**: Overlooking performance implications of concurrency choices

### Staying Fluent

1. **Memory Optimization**:
   ```go
   // AI might suggest:
   func Process(items []string) []string {
       result := make([]string, 0)
       for _, item := range items {
           result = append(result, process(item))
       }
       return result
   }
   
   // Better:
   func Process(items []string) []string {
       result := make([]string, len(items))
       for i, item := range items {
           result[i] = process(item)
       }
       return result
   }
   ```

2. **Benchmarking and Profiling**:
   - CPU profiling
   - Memory profiling
   - Block profiling
   - Mutex profiling

3. **Performance Patterns**:
   - Object pooling
   - Memory reuse
   - Efficient data structures

### Key Takeaways

- Master Go's profiling tools
- Understand memory allocation patterns
- Learn to optimize for GC
- Practice performance testing
- Consider concurrency impact
